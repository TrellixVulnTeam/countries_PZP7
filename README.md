## Development server

The map was build using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and GeoJSON.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.1.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

$ npm install leaflet
$ npm install -D @types/leaflet
```
